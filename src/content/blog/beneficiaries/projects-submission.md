In the ever-evolving landscape of decentralized governance, Octant stands as a beacon of opportunity for projects that aim to make a positive impact on the world of public goods. Octant is your partner in funding innovative projects, including you!

We’re excited to unveil the Octant Community Project Submission Proposal Process. This process streamlines funding, ensuring that projects aligned with our mission receive the support they deserve. We are sharing the steps below.

## Step 1: Join the Octant Discord Server

Before diving into the application process, immerse yourself in the Octant community by joining [our Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/octant/). Here, you'll find an interactive space to discuss your ideas, clarify doubts, and initiate preliminary discussions about your project. It's where collaboration begins. It's important that your project is active in engaging with the Octant community during the course of the given Epoch.

## Step 2: Initial Discussion

Use our Discord for initial feedback. Engage with the community to gauge how well your project aligns with Octant's [Project Eligibility criteria](https://docs.octant.app/propose-a-project.html). Ensure your project resonates with community interests and is likely to secure funding. Feel free to ask any questions or seek guidance from fellow community members. We're here to help you succeed.

## Step 3: Complete Submission Form

Ready to formalize your proposal? Below you'll find our standardized submission form. Please provide the essential details, including:

- Project Name:
- Project Description and why it's classified as a Public Good:
- Main Project Funding Sources:
- Seeking project-specific funding or funding for general operations:
- Project Roadmap and Milestones (only for project-specific funding):
- Funding Request and Budget (only for project-specific funding):
- Team Information, including backgrounds and roles:
- Social Credibility (development progress, awards, notable GitHub commits, referrals):
- Discord contact:

**Eligibility Criteria** are also essential, so [make sure to review them](https://docs.octant.app/propose-a-project.html) to ensure that your project aligns with what's listed below:

- [x] Do you have a commitment to open-source (i.e. every open-source license accepted by the [Open-Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/licenses/)) technology and sharing results publicly?
- [ ] Have you provided transparency about how exactly funding will be used?
- [ ] Are you advancing values of freedom and privacy (no surveillance and handling of personal data)?
- [ ] Are you supporting decentralization in various fields (for example building [Web3 projects](https://ethereum.org/en/web3/))?
- [ ] Have you provided social media channels to the extent that we can confirm social proof of your project?

Once your form is complete, submit it for initial review as a message to the [Octant_Submissions](https://discordapp.com/users/1148989551453413418) Discord account. The Octant team will assess your proposal's alignment with our mission. The application process is iterative, evolving as we encounter various projects and edge cases.

## Step 4: Q&A On Your Project

After your project clears our initial review, you'll be directed to submit it on our [Discourse](https://discuss.octant.app/) and Discord. It's important you stay engaged with the Octant community discussion following this submission. It's your space to address feedback, answer questions, and further refine your proposal. Building community support is a crucial step in the process.

In addition, we will offer potential beneficiaries the opportunity to present their projects in live Q&A sessions before the Allocation Window begins. For Epoch 1, these sessions will take place during two time frames: the first from September 29th to October 8th, and the second from October 9th to October 18th.

## Step 5: Community Voting

If we receive more submissions than there are available spots in the pool of potential beneficiaries for the upcoming Allocation Window, a [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/octantapp.eth/) vote will be organized to determine the final shortlist. Only users who have locked their GLM into [Octant](https://octant.app/) before the start of the Snapshot poll will be eligible to participate.

## Epoch One and Deadlines

We are currently in Epoch One, which will conclude on October 19th. This will be followed by a two-week Allocation Window that ends on November 2nd. During this window, GLM token holders who have locked their tokens into the Octant app will have the opportunity to decide how the rewards are distributed.

Our goal is to add up to 10 more projects to the existing pool of potential beneficiaries before the first Allocation Window begins. **If you're considering submitting a project, please complete your Submission Form (as detailed in Step 3) by September 28th**, three weeks before the end of Epoch One. Should we receive more than 10 submissions, we will organize a Snapshot vote to determine the shortlist. This potential Snapshot vote is slated to begin on September 29th and conclude on October 5th.
